# Tabber Goals - Test Version  
This version of **Tabber Goals** is the first test of a bigger AI-powered application. As of now, users can perform basic operations such as creating, updating, and deleting goals.  
Using WPF, the app has a simple and intuitive user interface that is self-explanatory and easy to use. Data entered into the application is stored in a local database.  
**This version of Tabber Goals is intended for developers, as it is a test build of a piece of software that will be further developed and made more stable.**  

# Roadmap  
As this repository serves as a simple prototype for testing CRUD operations and business logic, a new, real-world version of Tabber Goals is in the works.  
This upcoming version will incorporate the latest AI models for powerful goal insights, utilize the latest WinUI3 library for an even better look and feel, 
and employ a remote Azure database for data storage. The features of this new version of Tabber Goals are quite comprehensive but are not ready to be shared just yet.
